h1. bot_write_tab_customize

*Note: this version is for the new layout in Textpattern v4.6 and is not compatible with earlier versions of Textpattern.*

This plugin provides the ability to customize "Textpattern's":http://www.textpattern.com "write" tab. It makes it possible to rearrange UI items, hide parts of the UI on a per-section basis, hide specific sections from the _sections_ dropdown and more. By combining its features you can re-arrange the _write_ tab differently depending on the section you choose in the _sections_ dropdown. Used on its own or together with other plugins (e.g. glz_custom_fields and bot_admin_body_class), it will help you customize the Textpattern admin area to meet your clients needs. 


h2(#installation). Installation

Paste the .txt or .zip.txt package code into the Admin > Plugins tab, install and enable the plugin. Visit the "Extensions" tab and customize your write tab settings.


h2(#features). Features

* Single items (custom fields, body, excerpt etc.) or whole regions can be moved around relative to other single items or regions
* Items can be hidden on a per-section basis
* Sections can be hidden from the "write" tab sections dropdown (for static sections like "about us" or "search") 
* A custom css class can be set for each item. This let's you define classes for items that are not normally targetable with simple css.
* Javascript code can be set directly through the plugin interface. Particularly useful for use with an external jquery plugin and in conjunction with the ability to add a css class to any item on the page. The script will be executed only in the _write_ tab.
* Advanced settings for hiding / attributing classes to multiple items – helpful on sites with lots of custom fields. 
* Compatible with glz_custom_fields, rah_section_titles and rah_write_each_section 

bot_wtc's rearranging capability offers a simple way of customizing Textpattern, but is just one tool for customizing the admin area. More extensive modifications, e.g adapting Textpattern your customer's branding, can be achieved by creating an own admin theme.


h2(#example). A simple example

Suppose you want a shorter _Menu-title_ to show beneath the regular _Title_ field.

* Define a custom field called Menu-title.
* In bot_write_tab_customize, set the rule "Menu-title" > After > "Title".

Suppose you have a section where articles won't appear as their own page (for example a section holding FAQ questions and answers), and therefore don't need a Menu-title of their own.

* In bot_write_tab_customize, check the box next to "FAQ" in the "hide in" section for "Menu-title". It will no longer appear for FAQ articles.

Another example:

You want to draw attention to some specific fields to ensure they are not overlooked by making them pulsate briefly when then write tab loads.

* In bot_write_tab_customize, assign a class "required" to all the items that need to be filled out.
* Add the appropriate javascript code in the javascript box as follows (use the buttons to insert blueprint code):

bc. <script src= "../js/jquery.pulsate.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $(".required").pulsate({times:3});
});
</script>

You can extend this principle to validate fields prior to saving the article.


h3. A little tip 

Newer versions of Textpattern have brought extensive enhancements to the "write" tab, but there can be some  drawbacks. Almost every item now has an id or a class which means snappier jquery execution and also makes it possible to hide these elements with simple css in a theme.

A problem can occur if, using bot_write_tab_customize, you hide the label headings for each collapsible group. The "twisty" arrow that allows you to show/hide the group will no longer be accessible. Fortunately, you can fix this by inserting a tiny jQuery rule in the js box:

bc. <script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
  $(".toggle").show();
});
</script>

This makes all collapsible groups visible, allowing you to hide the heading with css while still ensuring the fields remain visible even if the user has them set to collapse.


h2(#upgrading). Upgrade notes 

The plugin should take care of updating the data stored in the db on activation. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to back up your database prior to updating so that you can restore your settings should something go awry. 


h2(#issues). Notes and known issues

* The order in which the rules for moving items are inserted *does* matter. Rules are executed from top to bottom so if the sequence gets garbled it's advisable to delete them all and start over.
* Class names must be inserted *without* the dot.
* If you want to hide an item in *all sections*, it is more efficient to hide items using css – for example @.override-form {display:none;}@ – than it is to hide them using this plugin.
* This plugin may not function properly if you have the Suhosing module (a security-related module for PHP) installed. In this case follow "these instructions":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=243861#p243861" (thanks maniqui!).


h2(#compile). Compiling the plugin from the source files

The @.txt@ and @.zip.txt@ can be used immediately. For those interested in forking and extending the plugin, this plugin follows gocom's "plugin structure":https://github.com/gocom/abc_plugin and can be compiled using "rah_plugcompiler":https://github.com/gocom/MassPlugCompiler as follows:

* clone/download "rah_plugcompiler":https://github.com/gocom/MassPlugCompiler to your local computer.
* In the terminal:

bc.. cd /path/to/rah_plugincompiler
php compile /path/to/bot_wtc /path/to/bot_wtc/packages

p. This should generate @txt@ and @.zip.txt@ installable plugins in the @/packages@ subdirectory.
